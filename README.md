# 📋 OrangeHRM - Manual QA Portfolio 🚀

Welcome to my Manual QA repository. This project demonstrates a full testing lifecycle (STLC) for the **OrangeHRM** system, an open-source HR management platform. 

The goal of this project was to analyze requirements, plan the testing strategy, and execute various testing types (Sanity, Regression, Functional) to ensure system stability.

## 🔄 From Manual to Automation
This manual project served as the foundation for my **Automation Framework**. I took the core scenarios from the STD and automated them using Java & Selenium.
